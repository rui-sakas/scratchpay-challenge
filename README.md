## UI for managing users

A react project to perform CRUD operations on User entities, build with React, React-Redux and Redux Saga.
For mocking the server-side, I used [Mirage](https://miragejs.com/).

## Installation

This project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run.
Install the dependencies and start the server.

```sh
yarn install
yarn start
```
